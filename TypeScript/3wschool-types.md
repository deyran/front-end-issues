# TypeScript

## Main primitives types

* There are three primitive types in TypeScript:

1. boolean
2. number
3. string

## Type assignment

* These primitive types can be assigned in two ways: Explicit and Implicit.

1. Explicit

```js
let firstName: string = "Deyvid";
```

2. Implicit. In that case, it forces TypeScript to infer the value

```js
let firstName = "Deyvid";
```

## Special types

There are three kinds of special types, that are: any, unknown, never, undefined and null.
