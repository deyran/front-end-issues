# [What is TypeScript?](https://youtu.be/d56mG7DezGs?t=178)
In this section we will look at these issues:
1. What is TypeScript?
2. Why do we need it?
3. How is it different from JavaScript?

## [What is TypeScript?](https://youtu.be/d56mG7DezGs?t=193)
* A programming language created at Microsoft to address shortcomings of JavaScript. TypeScript is a language program built on top of Javascript, so every JavaScript file is a TypeScript file.
* These are the benefits of TypeScript language programming:
1. Static typing - means that you must to declare explicitly the type of any variable and that variable cannot be assigned a different type of variable.
2. Code completion
3. Refactoring
4. Shorthand notations
